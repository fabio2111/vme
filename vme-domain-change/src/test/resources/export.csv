23053,"2012 Sep. Fisheries Commission Meeting. FC adopted recommendations from WGFMS-VME to (a) expand the list of VME Indicator Species and Elements, (b) clarify exploratory bottom fishing activities, (c) strengthen the assessment of bottom fishing activities, and (d) modify the thresholds on sponges and corals and include a threshold for sea pens [Agenda Item 15; Annex 12; Annex 13]. FC also deleted a provision for exploratory fisheries in the closed seamounts [Agenda Item 16]. A proposal to protect a proposed EBSA in the Sargasso Sea was discussed but not adopted because the EBSA itself had not yet been approved by CBD, but FC did adopt a resolution to urge other international organisations to reduce the risk impact from non-fisheries human activities to closed areas [Agenda Item 17]. The FC Requests for Scientific Advice included No. 7 on encounter thresholds and move-on rules of for small gorgonian corals, large gorgonian corals, sea squirts, erect bryozoans, crinoids and cerianthid anemone which are VME indicator species; No. 10 on the re-ssessment of fishing activity related to SAI on VMEs; No. 15 on ikely impacts to the Sargasso Sea; and No. 16 on fishing effort and rick to VMEs.

23059,"2012: SC met three times during 2012, but only discussed VME issues in their June meeting. Based on an analysis of recent benthic survey data, and using criteria in the FAO DSF Guidelines, SC extended the list of VME indicators that now includes species of large sponges, stony corals, gorgonian corals, sea pens, erect bryozoans, sea lilies, and sea squirts. Also included was a list of VME elements found in the NRA that includes seamounts, canyon heads, spawning areas and knolls [VII.1.c.xii Detailed list of VME Indicator species], with these being mapped [VII.1.c.xv Mapping of VME indicator species and elements]. Advances in GIS model using VMS data for developing sponge bycatch thresholds [VII.1.c.xiii GIS modeling of sponge encounters using VMS data] that lead to the further development of threshold levels that had a more meaningful biological basis. [VII.1.c.xiv Encounter thresholds and move on rules]. A work plan for the reassessment of VMEs were undertaken that included both the evaluation of impacts on VMEs and the management of the fisheries themselves [VII.1.c.xvi Development of a work plan for reassessment of VMEs]. SC reviewed the report of WGEAFM and discussed the controversial issue of trawl sampling by research vessels in closed areas describing the trade-offs between sampling needs and potential impact. A summary of the WGDEC report was presented to SC that discussed many important and diverse issues. It was noted that the NAFO Secretariat had attended the FAO VME Database workshop, and CWP and GIS meetings."

(Item 9) SC analysed fishing activities for 2003-2007 using VMS These data indicated that there was no evidence of fishing on Orphan Knoll, and that a few exploratory tows probably occurred on the Newfoundland Seamounts. Limited commercial fishing activity was observed on the New England and Corner Seamounts, although one small area in the Corner Seamounts was repeatedly fished over several seasons and by Russian vessels in the 1970s. The most important species in the catches were alfonsino (Beryx splendens), black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) and wreckfish (Polyprion americanus). (VII.1.d.v. Information on Seamounts).

23141,"FC introduced the NEREIDA project side-event. The NEREIDA conducts multidisciplinary research surveys on vulnerable ecosystems and the effects of fishing activities. The survey is funded by EU-Spain, Canada, EU-United Kingdom and the Russian Federation. Specific objectives include identifying organisms that constitute Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs), describing ecology of deep-sea habitats studying distinct features in the area and developing a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) database. Deep-sea Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) took video footage of both pristine coral areas and areas where corals had been impacted by bottom contact gears. [IV. Ecosystem Considerations]. The six seamount closures were rolled over for four years until 31 December 2014. [IV.11. Review of seamounts closure]. WGFMS VME presented (a) revised Exploratory Fishery Data Collection Form, (b) revised Article 5bis of the NCEM on Interim Encounter Provision, (c) map of existing fishing areas in the NAFO Regulatory area, and (d) updated Chapter Ibis of the NCEM, which were adopted by FC. The (e) revised Article 4bis on Assessment of Bottom Fishing was considered by FC who adopted an alternative proposal [Annex 12.

Initially, four seamount areas were closed as a precautionary measure and a request made for contracting parties to submit their benthic survey data. SC established WGEAFM and also worked jointly with ICES WGDEC to provide advice to FC.  Extensive data sets from Canadian Government fisheries surveys were used to provide initial distributions of corals and sponges and these were later supplemented by dedicated Canadian and Spanish NERIDA project cruises in 2008-2010. Early fishing and benthic surveys undertaken in the 1970s by Russia provided much of the historical seamount information.  NAFO has a total of 18 areas that delimit the most significant areas of corals and sponges in the NRA and are closed to fishing with bottom contact fishing gears. There are now a total of 18 closed areas within the NRA providing protection to vulnerable marine ecosystems on seamounts, slopes and canyons (CEM, 2011-2012)."

23784,"CCAMLR have four designated classes of fishing area. New fisheries, including the use of bottom trawls in high-seas areas, are permitted only under approval from the Commission  in areas and on species that have no or little existing catch data and are subject to strict control (CM 21-01 (2010)). Exploratory fisheries arise from “Commission-approved” new fisheries and are still subject to strict monitoring and control protocols (CM 21-02 (2011)). The established fisheries are identified by specific conservation measures. The only established  commercial bottom fishing permitted is for toothfish (Dissostichus spp) and is conducted by bottom trawls and longlines. In general, scientific research is except from many of the CM restrictions though catch limits still normally apply (CM 24-01 (2011). Certain areas may be open to scientific or research fishing only, for example, there is a small bottom trawl fishery for mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) in part of division 58.5.2 for research only (CM 42-02 (2011)). Areas not identified as above are closed to bottom trawl fishing (CM 22-05(2008)). Deep-sea gillnetting is not permitted in any area (CM 22-04 (2010)). There are also areas closed to fishing for a variety of reasons, including the presents of VMEs."
23786,"In order to protect benthic habitats, CCAMLR does not permit deep-sea gillnetting (CM 22-04 (2010)), bottom trawling (CM 22-05 (2008)), and exploratory fisheries for toothfish in waters shallower than 550 m (CM 22-08 (2009)). CCMLAR also notifies encounters with potential VME areas above a threshold level (CM 22-06 (2010)) as VME risk areas eliciting a 1nm closure that is subject to review by scientific council (CM 22-07 (2011)). Sub-threshold VME encounters, if occurring in close proximity, result is the notification of VME fine-scale rectangles, which are not subject to any management measure but do indicate the presents of potential VMEs in the area (CM 22-07 (2011)). Notified VMEs occurring in areas not subject to protection from SAI caused by bottom contact gears can be registered and closed (CM 22-09 (2011))."

As such, measures are voluntary and under the control of each member state or fishing entity. There have been approximately two meetings each year since 2006. Considerable effort has been made to support the requests made by the UNGA, especially those in UNGA Res. 61/105 on deepsea fisheries. In 2009, interim measures for the northwest Pacific Ocean were adopted that limited bottom fishing to areas currently fished south of 45 N and limited effort to no more than current levels. Areas north of 45 N are considered as new fishing areas and would be subject to the exploratory fishing protocol. As of October 2008, the following seamounts have been identified as fished seamounts: Suiko, [Showa], Youmei, Nintoku, Jingu, Ojin, Northern Koko, Koko, Kinmei, Yuryaku, Kammu, Colahan, and C-H. (Annex 2 of interim measures, NPFC 2009c)
Interim measures for the northeast Pacific Ocean were adopted in 2011, though there were no divisions of this area into existing and new fishing areas. The Scientific Working Group was formed in 2006 and meet in 2007. It has been compiling information on areas subject to bottom fishing, with good descriptions of fisheries available on the NPFC web pages (http://nwpbfo.nomaki.jp/Fisheries.html.)"

SAC discussed this and strongly advised to refrain expanding deep water fishing operations beyond the limit of 1 000 m (which is a depth limit currently not exploited), in view of unmapped sensitive habitats (deep water coral reefs, sea vents, sea mounds, etc.), the fragile nature of deep water fish assemblages, and the presence of juvenile crustaceans.

31196,"In 2005, GFCM adopted ""Recommendation GFCM/2005/1” that prohibit the use of towed dredges and trawl nets fisheries at depths beyond 1000 m of depth”. The preamble to this recommendation notes that this is mainly for the protection of fish stocks and halting the expansion of fisheries into deeper waters when the stock status is unknown. The Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) provided the following paragraph in support of this recommendation to the Commission “The Committee [SAC] strongly advised to refrain expanding deep water fishing operations beyond the limit of 1 000 m (which is a depth limit currently not exploited), in view of scientific considerations on the presence both of unmapped sensitive habitats (deep water coral reefs, sea vents, sea mounds, etc.), and of the fragile nature of deep water fish assemblages as well as the presence of juveniles of different crustaceans species at such depths” [7th SAC Report, para. 80].<br>In 2007, the 10th SAC meeting of GFCM established the term Fisheries Restricted Area (FRA) and provisionally approved a standard format for submitting new proposals of FRA. [para. 56; Appendix D]. SAC endorsed a provisional definition of a FRA “A geographically-defined area in which all or certain fishing activities are temporally or permanently banned or restricted in order to improve the exploitation and conservation of harvested living aquatic resources or the protection of marine ecosystems.” These areas can include benthic habitats with criteria that match or are similar to those provided by the FAO DSF Guidelines for VMEs. FRAs are adopted by the Commission and can have management measures that can be closures to specified fishing gears (e.g. to towed dredges and bottom trawl nets in the Nile delta area cold hydrocarbon seeps, the Eratosthemes Seamount, and Lophelia reef off Capo Santa Maria di Leuca FRAs) or it could be an effort restriction (eg fishing effort for specified gears on demersal stocks shall not exceed the 2008 level). GFCM has not adopted general measures for the protection of VMEs that apply to existing and new fishing areas (which have not been defined in GFCM). There are currently no requirements under GFCM recommendations to collect information pertaining to the bycatch of deepwater corals and sponges, though considerable effort has been made through recommendations adopted in 2009 to develop a list of fishing vessels and gears.<br>In 2013, Resolution GFCM/37/2013/1 resolves that FRAs shall be designated by GFCM including where they overlap with the UNEP-MAP SPAMI designation. FRAs are “to maintain and/or recovery of marine living resources to an healthy state while ensuring the conservation of marine biodiversity for the sustainable exploitation” (paragraph 3)."

31440,"Het Mexicaanse telecomconcern América Móvil heeft een bod gedaan om KPN over te nemen. Het bedrijf van multimiljardair Carlos Slim heeft al een belang van bijna 30 procent in KPN en wil het bedrijf nu in zijn geheel inlijven. Wat moet de op een na rijkste man ter wereld met de Koninklijke PTT Nederland?  Chef van de economieredactie van de Volkskrant Xander van Uffelen denkt dat Carlos Slim enigszins verbolgen is over het feit dat KPN de Duitse tak E-Plus van de hand wil doen. KPN wilde E-Plus verkopen aan het Spaanse Telefónica, een van de grote concurrenten van Slim in Zuid-Amerika.   'Door een overname van KPN door América Móvil kan hij dat voorkomen. Want KPN staat met E-Plus redelijk sterk in Duitsland, maar als ze die tak kwijtraken, wordt het schier onmogelijk om er nog voet aan de grond te krijgen voor Slim. En het is de grootste telecommarkt van Europa, dus hij moest iets doen.'  De Duitse markt kent een aantal grote spelers die niet voor overname is aanmerking komen. De Britten zitten er met hun Vodafone, de Duitsers zelf met T-Mobile en het Spaanse Telefónica heeft er ook een aanzienlijk aandeel.   Rijkste man ter wereld Slim (73) verloor vorig jaar de titel 'rijkste man ter wereld' aan Microsoft-oprichter Bill Gates. Een van de redenen dat Slim zijn titel weer moest inleveren was de belegging in KPN in 2012. Hij moest al snel een 1 miljard euro bijstorten om KPN van de ondergang te redden.  Analisten dachten dat dat Slim's America Móvil daarna geen geld meer zou hebben om KPN in zijn geheel over te nemen. Het zou voor de overname te veel geld moeten lenen. Maar de analisten krijgen ongelijk en Móvil biedt 2,40 euro per aandeel, dat komt neer op zo'n 7,2 miljard euro in totaal.  América Móvil is ook al actief in Oostenrijk en probeert nu dus ook via Nederland en de buitenlandse takken van KPN zijn imperium in Europa te laten landen.Het Mexicaanse telecomconcern América Móvil heeft een bod gedaan om KPN over te nemen.

Maar de analisten krijgen ongelijk en Móvil biedt 2,40 euro per aandeel, dat komt neer op zo'n 7,2 miljard euro in totaal.  América Móvil is ook al actief in Oostenrijk en probeert nu dus ook via Nederland en de buitenlandse takken van KPN zijn imperium in Europa te laten landen.Het Mexicaanse telecomconcern América Móvil heeft een bod gedaan om KPN over te nemen. Het bedrijf van multimiljardair Carlos Slim heeft al een belang van bijna 30 procent in KPN en wil het bedrijf nu in zijn geheel inlijven. Wat moet de op een na rijkste man ter wereld met de Koninklijke PTT Nederland?  Chef van de economieredactie van de Volkskrant Xander van Uffelen denkt dat Carlos Slim enigszins verbolgen is over het feit dat KPN de Duitse tak E-Plus van de hand wil doen. KPN wilde E-Plus verkopen aan het Spaanse Telefónica, een van de grote concurrenten van Slim in Zuid-Amerika.   'Door een overname van KPN door América Móvil kan hij dat voorkomen. Want KPN staat met E-Plus redelijk sterk in Duitsland, maar als ze die tak kwijtraken, wordt het schier onmogelijk om er nog voet aan de grond te krijgen voor Slim. En het is de grootste telecommarkt van Europa, dus hij moest iets doen.'  De Duitse markt kent een aantal grote spelers die niet voor overname is aanmerking komen. De Britten zitten er met hun Vodafone, de Duitsers zelf met T-Mobile en het Spaanse Telefónica heeft er ook een aanzienlijk aandeel.

26545,"The bottom fisheries in the Convention Area currently target Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni), and mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari). These fisheries are managed using the ecosystem-based and precautionary approach, and management objectives which balance ‘conservation’ and ‘rational use’ of living resources and maintain existing ecological relationships. The fisheries operate in a regulatory framework which recognises five types of fisheries that reflect the stage of development and the level of information available to make management decisions. [http://www.ccamlr.org/en/fisheries/fisheries]. Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) and Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) are targeted by licensed fisheries in the Southern Ocean, using mainly bottom-set longlines in depths of 1 200–1 800 m. These species may also be caught by trawl and pot. There are 13 licensed fisheries currently targeting toothfish in Areas 48, 58 and 88, including seven exploratory fisheries. [http://www.ccamlr.org/en/fisheries/toothfish-fisheries]. Mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) is targeted by licensed fisheries in the Southern Ocean using midwater trawls at South Georgia in Subarea 48.3, and using both bottom and midwater trawls at Heard and McDonald Islands in Division 58.5.2. [http://www.ccamlr.org/en/fisheries/icefish-fisheries]. 
Details of the current status of bottom fisheries is provided by CAMMLR in an appendix to its annual Fisheries Report ""Report on bottom fisheries and vulnerable marine ecosystems"" (e.g. for 2012 [http://www.ccamlr.org/en/system/files/appF_8.pdf]"
26546,"In 2006, the Commission and the Scientific Committee began to discuss methods to eliminate destructive fishing practices on benthic ecosystems, adopting a measure to control bottom trawling in high-seas areas (Conservation Measure (CM) 21-05). In that same year, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) agreed the Sustainable Fisheries Resolution (61/105), which calls on States and regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) or other arrangements to take immediate action to ensure fish stocks are managed sustainably and to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs), including seamounts, hydrothermal vents and cold-water corals, from destructive fishing practices. More specifically, UNGA Resolution 61/105 calls on States and RFMOs and other arrangements to regulate and manage all bottom fisheries in high-seas areas so as to prevent significant adverse impacts on VMEs by no later than 31 December 2008 (UNGA Resolution 61/105, OP80–OP91). Since then, the Scientific Committee has provided advice on methods to implement this resolution. The issue has been considered primarily in WG-FSA but with increasing attention of WG-SAM on methods and WG-EMM on the biology and ecology of VMEs. In 2009, a Workshop on VMEs (WS-VME) was held (SC-CAMLR-XXVIII, Annex 10). This report aims to summarise the current scientific advice pertinent to this issue. [Report on bottom fisheries and vulnerable marine ecosystems, Para 1-2, http://www.ccamlr.org/en/system/files/appF_8.pdf]
In order to protect benthic habitats, CCAMLR does not permit deep-sea gillnetting (CM 22-04 (2010)), bottom trawling (CM 22-05), and exploratory fisheries for toothfish in waters shallower than 550 m (CM 22-08). VMEs occurring in areas currently open to bottom fisheries are closed so as to avoid and SAI caused by bottom contact gears (CM 22-09). CCMLAR also notifies encounters with potential VME areas above a threshold level (CM 22-06) as VME risk areas eliciting a 1nm closure that is subject to review by scientific council (CM 22-07). Sub-threshold VME encounters, if occurring in close proximity, result is the notification of VME fine-scale rectangles, which are not subject to additional management measure but do indicate the presents of potential VMEs in the area (CM 22-07). 
In 2007, the Scientific Committee endorsed the conclusions of WG-FSA that specific guidance would need to be developed to adequately monitor fisheries by-catch for evidence of encounters with vulnerable habitats and to potentially trigger management actions (SC-CAMLR-XXVI, paragraphs 4.164 and 4.165). The CCAMLR VME Taxa Classification Guide, adopted for use by fishing vessels, is publicly available on the CCAMLR website [www.ccamlr.org/node/74322]."

26548,"Encounters with potential VMEs trigger the ""Risk Area"" protocol that vessels stop fishing in the area and notify the Secretariate and Flag state. An area of 1 nmile radius is closed around the location of the catch. The status of the ""risk area"" is subsequently reviewed by the Scientific Commmittee. CCAMLR also has a lower threshold level where catches of 5-9 indicator units are notified but no measures are applied (CM 22-07 (2010))."

The guide includes various corals, sponges, along with representatives from 10 other phyla. No snails, starfish or crabs are included."
26550,"Thresholds are defined in terms of “indicator units”. Para 2(iii) defines an indicator unit which is approximately 1L or 1 kg. A catch of 10+ indicator units signifies an encounter with a potential VME.

28241,"Entry into force of CMM 2.03 Conservation and Management Measure for the Management of Bottom Fishing in the SPRFMO Convention Area.  
The objective of this measure is to promote the sustainable management of bottom fisheries including target fish stocks as well as non-target species taken as bycatch, in these fisheries, and to protect the marine ecosystems in which those resources occur, including inter alia, the prevention of significant adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems."
28243,"The objective of the SPRFMO Convention is, through the application of the precautionary approach and an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fishery resources and, in so doing, to safeguard the marine ecosystems in which these resources occur.
In May 2007, Interim Management Measures for bottom fisheries were adopted at the 3rd International Consultations.  These voluntary measures committed the Participants to not expand bottom fishing activates into new regions of the (Convention) Area where such fishing is not currently occurring.   The Interim Benthic Assessment framework (also adopted at the 3rd International consultation) lead to the creation of a SPRFMO joint trawl footprint map.  This joint trawl footprint map was defined using bottom trawl tracks, 20 minute resolution blocks and a reference period of 2002-2006.  Participants in (benthic and bentho-pelagic) trawl fisheries in the SPRFMO Area agreed not to fish outside this joint trawl footprint.  Australia, Chile, Korea and New Zealand all submitted bottom footprint data which were used in the creation of the SPRFMO joint trawl footprint map.
In addition, SPRFMO CMM 1.02 (adopted Feb 2013) prohibited the use of all deepwater gillnets in the Convention Area.  
An analysis of demersal fished areas using Australia-New Zealand demersal trawl data for 1990-2006 was presented at the 1st SC meeting in 2013. 
SPRFMO CMM 2.03 (adopted Jan 2014) promoted the sustainable management of bottom fisheries including target fish stocks as well as non-target species taken as bycatch, in these fisheries, and to protect the marine ecosystems in which those resources occur, including inter alia, the prevention of significant adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems."
28245,"The Conservation and Management Measures adopted by the Commission shall include measures to protect the habitats and marine ecosystems in which fishery resources and non-target and associated or dependent species occur from the impacts of fishing, including measures to prevent significant adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems and precautionary measures where it cannot adequately be determined whether vulnerable marine ecosystems are present or whether fishing would cause significant adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems.
In May 2007, Interim Management Measures for bottom fisheries were adopted at the 3rd International Consultation. This initiative was taken by the Participants prior to the formal establishment of the SPRFMO and the measures are voluntary. Paragraph 6 contained the precautionary actions needed to protect identified or likely VMEs areas (including assessments).  Paragraph 7 included move-on rules and reporting requirements when evidence of VMEs was encountered during the course of fishing operations.  In Sep 2007, an interim benthic assessment framework was adopted to guide benthic assessments and enable the SWG to evaluate and comment on submitted assessments.  This framework was expanded into the Bottom Fishery Impact Assessment Standard in February 2012 which was adopted at The 3rd Session of the Preparatory Conference.  Both the framework and the standard contained sections that provided guidance on detecting evidence of VMEs, evaluating interactions with VMEs and the likelihood of Significant Adverse Impacts. 
Australia and New Zealand have submitted Bottom Fishery Impact Assessments.  The European Union has completed a preliminary assessment of the risk of causing serious damage to VMEs.
Chile and New Zealand have provided information concerning the potential location and identification of VMEs.  In addition New Zealand has reported evidence of VME encounters during 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.

27649,"The Commission received a summary of recent developments in international and regional fora, including a letter from OSPAR drawing the need to protect corals or the western slopes of the Rockall Bank. There were concerns that the current Convention for NEAFC’s mandate to deal only with fisheries may be too limited in future, and that there may be a need to expand the remit of the Convention to management of the oceans in a wider perspective (NEAFC AM 2004, Agenda Item 13).
Norway delivered an information and discussion document noting that many international organisations (WSSD (2002), UNGA 58/14 (2003), CBD COP 7 (2004)) are calling for increased protection of benthic marine ecosystems and proposed that six areas should be closed to trawling: The Hecate and Faraday seamounts and a section of the Reykjanes Ridge on the MAR, the Altair Seamounts, west of the MAR, the Antialtair seamounts east of the MAR, and a specified sub-area of the Hatton Bank (NEAFC AM 2004, Agenda Item 13). From this, a joint proposal was developed and adopted for the closure of five areas (the above except Hatton Bank) to bottom trawling (Recommendation in NEAFC AM 2004/57).
The Commission requested advice from ICES on the distribution of cold-water corals around the proposed closed areas, and over the regulatory area more generally (NEAFC AM 2004, Annex L.2)."

27653,"ICES addressed the NEAFC request on seamount and coral distribution and on possible impacts from fishing. The advice was as comprehensive as possible, but it was noted that there is a paucity of information from which to draw firm conclusions, both on the distribution of corals and on the distribution and type of fishing activities (NEAFC AM 2005, Agenda Item 6g).
It was proposed that six additional areas should be closed to fishing. However, it was agreed that there was first a need to establish criteria and guidelines for closures and the proposal was therefore withdrawn (NEAFC AM 2005, Agenda Item 7g).
The NEAFC Secretary presents a summary of information on ocean governance and the protection of benthic habitats discussed at various international fora, including UNGA Res 59/24 on Oceans, UNGA Res. 59/25 on sustainable fisheries, and at FAO, UNEP and CBD (NEAFC AM 2005, Agenda Item 14)

Reference to cold-water corals and seamounts was first raised at the 2003 Annual Meeting by the NGO “Seas at Risk” during an observer statement. A request for scientific advice was forwarded to ICES the same year to provide information on habitats vulnerable to fishing activities. At the 2004 Annual Meeting, NEAFC closed five areas to protect VMEs for a period of three years whilst more information was collected. Since then, there has been an active dialogue between NEACF and ICES (particularly through the work of WG DEC) regarding VMEs. NEAFC have, since 2008, added new VMEs and modified the boundaries of existing VMEs, normally to add areas to protect newly discovered VMEs around the edges of existing VMEs. In 2014, NEAFC have a total of 12 benthic areas protected from significant impacts of bottom fishing."

28205,"Final Act of the International Consultations on the Establishment of the Proposed SPRFMO.  In 2006, Australia, Chile and New Zealand initiated a process of consultations to enable States to cooperate in addressing the gap that existed in the international conservation and management of non-highly migratory fisheries and protection of biodiversity in the marine environment in the high seas areas of the South Pacific Ocean.  Eight meetings of the International consultations were held beginning 14 February 2006 and concluding 14 November 2009.  Those meetings were hosted in Australia (2), Chile, Ecuador, New Caledonia, New Zealand (2) and Peru.  
The First Meeting established a Science Working Group (SWG) whose work programme included the evaluation of benthic fishery impact assessments.  
The Third meeting adopted Interim Measures for Pelagic Fisheries and for Bottom Fisheries.  
On recommendation of the SWG, the Fourth Meeting adopted the Interim Benthic Assessment Framework to guide benthic Assessments.  
The Eight Meeting agreed that the work of the SWG, in particular, evaluation of benthic impact assessments to support the Interim Measures would continue pending the entry into force of the Convention.  The Eight meeting also considered the Interim Measures deepwater gillnet fisheries for implementation from 1 February 2010. On 14 February the Eight Meeting  adopted  the Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fishery Resources in the South Pacific Ocean together with a resolution regarding establishment of a Preparatory Conference to make arrangements for the entry into force of the Convention."

29582,"Studies carried out in the area reveal a rich and diverse ecosystem, notably comprised by two species of scleractinian corals (Caryophyllia calveri and Desmophyllum cristagalli), which were the first live records from the Levant Basin and significantly extended the species’ depth ranges, a rare deep water sponge, Hamacantha implicans, known previously from a canyon in the western Mediterranean, a remarkably dense population of the deep water actinarian Kadophellia bathyalis, and unidentified zoantharians and antipatharians. The high faunal diversity and density indicate a uniquely rich environment in the Levant Basin, possibly an isolated refuge for relict populations of species that have disappeared from the adjacent continental slope.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">NPFC has existed in an interim phase since 2006. It will be
formally constituted upon ratification of its convention. As such, measures are
voluntary and under the control of each member state or fishing entity. There
have been approximately two meetings each year since 2006. Considerable effort
has been made to support the requests made by the UNGA, especially those in
UNGA Res. 61/105 on deepsea fisheries. </p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In 2007, interim measures for the northwest Pacific Ocean
were adopted that limit effort to no more than current levels and limit bottom
fisheries to seamounts located south of 45<span style=""mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"">°</span>North and not allow bottom fisheries to expand into
areas of the Northwestern Pacific Ocean where no such fishing is currently
occurring. Exception may be provided subject to an exploratory fishery
protocol.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">As of October 2008, the following seamounts have been
identified as fished seamounts: Suiko, Youmei, Nintoku, Jingu, Ojin, Northern
Koko, Koko, Kinmei, Yuryaku, Kammu, Colahan, and C-H (Annex 2 of interim
measures, NPFC 2009c). Trawl fisheries are currently (2013) only conducted by
Japan and Korea. A history of the fisheries in the northwest Pacific can be
found at http://nwpbfo.nomaki.jp/Fisheries.html.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Interim measures for the northeast Pacific Ocean were
adopted in 2011. Canada submitted its fisheries assessment and identified four
seamounts in high seas where they have bottom fisheries, namely Eickelberg
Seamounts, Warwick Seamount, Cobb Seamounts, Brown Bear Seamounts (2008d). </p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Scientific Working Group was formed in 2006 and met
annually. It has been compiling information on areas subject to bottom fishing,
with good descriptions of fisheries available on the NPFC web pages
(http://nwpbfo.nomaki.jp/Fisheries.html.)</p>

The preamble to this recommendation notes that this is mainly for the protection of fish stocks and halting the expansion of fisheries into deeper waters when the stock status is unknown. SAC provided the following paragraph in support of this recommendation to the Commission “The Committee [SAC] strongly advised to refrain expanding deep water fishing operations beyond the limit of 1 000 m (which is a depth limit currently not exploited), in view of scientific considerations on the presence both of unmapped sensitive habitats (deep water coral reefs, sea vents, sea mounds, etc.), and of the fragile nature of deep water fish assemblages as well as the presence of juveniles of different crustaceans species at such depths” [7th SAC Report, para. 80]. The 10th SAC meeting of GFCM, in 2007, established the term Fisheries Restricted Area (FRA) and provisionally approved a standard format for submitting new proposals of (FRA). [56; Appendix D]. SAC endorsed a provisional definition of a FRA “A geographically-defined area in which all or certain fishing activities are temporally or permanently banned or restricted in order to improve the exploitation and conservation of harvested living aquatic resources or the protection of marine ecosystems.” These areas can include benthic habitats with criteria that match or are similar to those provided by the FAO DSF Guidelines for VMEs. FRAs are adopted by the Commission and can have management measures that can be closures to specified fishing gears (e.g. to towed dredges and bottom trawl nets in the The Nile delta area cold hydrocarbon seeps, The Eratosthemes Seamount, and Lophelia reef off Capo Santa Maria di Leuca FRAs) or it could be an effort restriction (eg fishing effort for specified gears on demersal stocks shall not exceed the 2008 level). GFCM has not adopted general measures for the protection of VMEs that apply to existing and new fishing areas (which are not defined in GFCM). There are currently no requirements under GFCM recommendations to collect information pertaining to the bycatch of deepwater corals and sponges, though considerable effort has been made through recommendations adopted in 2009 to develop a list of fishing vessels and gears. In 2013, Resolution GFCM/37/2013/1 resolves that FRAs shall be designated by GFCM including where they overlap with the UNEP-MAP SPAMI designation. FRAs are “to maintain and/or recovery of marine living resources to an healthy state while ensuring the conservation of marine biodiversity for the sustainable exploitation” (paragraph 3)."

31203,"Studies carried out in the area reveal a rich and diverse ecosystem, notably comprised by two species of scleractinian corals (<i>Caryophyllia calveri</i> and <i>Desmophyllum cristagalli</i>), which were the first live records from the Levant Basin and significantly extended the species’ depth ranges, a rare deep water sponge, <i>Hamacantha implicans</i>, known previously from a canyon in the western Mediterranean, a remarkably dense population of the deep water actinarian <i>Kadophellia bathyalis</i>, and unidentified zoantharians and antipatharians. The high faunal diversity and density indicate a uniquely rich environment in the Levant Basin, possibly an isolated refuge for relict populations of species that have disappeared from the adjacent continental slope. (SCMEE Report, Sep 2005, p. 3)"
31204,"No fishing activity is reported in the area. It is probably the most pristine environment found in the Mediterranean, and because of this, needs a protection status to avoid the threats posed by human activities. (SCMEE Report, Sep 2005, p. 3)"
31205,"The Eratosthenes Seamount is located in the Eastern Mediterranean, between the Levantine Platform to the south and the Cyprus margin to the north, near the subduction zone of the African plate, ca.100 km south of Cyprus (33°-34°N, 32°-33° E). The flat-topped seamount measures approximately 120 km in diameter at the base, and rises 1500 m above the adjacent bathyal plain, with a summit 756 m below sea level. (SCMEE Report, Sep 2005, p. 3)"

30645,"The Conservation and Management Measures adopted by the Commission shall include measures to protect the habitats and marine ecosystems in which fishery resources and non-target and associated or dependent species occur from the impacts of fishing, including measures to prevent significant adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems and precautionary measures where it cannot adequately be determined whether vulnerable marine ecosystems are present or whether fishing would cause significant adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems.<br>In May 2007, Interim Management Measures for bottom fisheries were adopted at the 3rd International Consultation. This initiative was taken by the Participants prior to the formal establishment of the SPRFMO and the measures are voluntary. Paragraph 6 contained the precautionary actions needed to protect identified or likely VMEs areas (including assessments).&nbsp; Paragraph 7 included move-on rules and reporting requirements when evidence of VMEs was encountered during the course of fishing operations.&nbsp; In Sep 2007, an interim benthic assessment framework was adopted to guide benthic assessments and enable the SWG to evaluate and comment on submitted assessments.&nbsp; This framework was expanded into the Bottom Fishery Impact Assessment Standard in February 2012 which was adopted at The 3rd Session of the Preparatory Conference.&nbsp; Both the framework and the standard contained sections that provided guidance on detecting evidence of VMEs, evaluating interactions with VMEs and the likelihood of Significant Adverse Impacts. <br>The use of deepwater gillnets was prohibited in the Convention Area under CMM 1.02 which was adopted at the 1st Commission Meeting (Auckland) in February 2013.<br>A Conservation and Management Measure for the Management of Bottom Fishing in the SPRFMO Convention Area (CMM 2.03) was adopted at the 2nd Commission meeting (Manta) in Janurary 2014.&nbsp; One of the Objectives of this CMM was to prevent Significant Adverse impacts on VMEs.&nbsp; CMM 2.03 expands on the earlier voluntary measure, and importantly contains specific requests for information from the Scientific Committee to enable to Commission to review the CMM in 2016. <br>Australia and New Zealand have submitted Bottom Fishery Impact Assessments.&nbsp; The European Union has completed a preliminary assessment of the risk of causing serious damage to VMEs.<br>Chile and New Zealand have provided information concerning the potential location and identification of VMEs.&nbsp; In addition New Zealand has reported evidence of VME encounters during 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Bottom Fishing methods currently used include bentho-pelagic trawling, bottom trawling, bottom longlining and potting.<br>"

30985,"Based upon a request to the SEAFO Scientific Committee by Japan to revise the fishing footprint and open new fishing areas to commercial fishing (Commission Report 2012, para 7.4), the Commission adopted rules for the opening of new fishing areas (Commission Report 2012, para. 8.15, p. 5; Annex 5,p. 113; CM 24/12). In 2011, SC submitted what it considered to be the final bottom fishing footprint at a resolution of 10”x10” based on submissions for the period 1987-2007 (Commission Report 2011, p. 61), with the proviso that it felt that the footprint may not fully reflect the actual area subjected to bottom fishing. Based on this, the Commission adopted a bottom fishing footprint based on 1degx1deg resolution within the reference period of 1987-July 2011 (Commission Report 2011, p.6; CM 22/11). "
30987,"Based upon a request to the Commission and in accordance with the SEAFOs exploratory fishing protocol, the Commission revised the existing SEAFO fishing area to include three new fishing area for commercial longline&nbsp; fishing (CM 26-13, Annex 1 and 2, p. 5-6)."
30988,"There were no encounters above threshold reported for 2010-2012. Japan reported on their exploratory fishing and noted that catches of VME indicator groups below 2 kg occurred in some sections of the exploratory area indicating that further assessment is required prior to modifying the footprint. (Commission report, 2012, p. 41)"
30990,"Reports were provided for the FAO workshop on VMEs and the CBD workshop on EBSAs in the SEAFO area.&nbsp; Further reports were provided by Japan on their exploratory fishing and it was noted that catches of VME indicators were less than 1.5 kg which is very much less that the threshold levels. It was further noted that this exploratory fishing was for bottom longlines that can be regarded as a VME safe gear. (Commission report, 2013)."
